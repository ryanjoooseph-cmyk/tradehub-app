  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Define the Dispute schema with fields: `id`, `evidence_urls`, `status`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
    - Implement methods for database interactions (CRUD operations).

#### 4. Middleware

- **File:** `src/services/disputeService.js`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Implement functions to call the API for creating, listing, and updating disputes.
    - Handle API responses and errors.

#### 7. State Management
- **File:** `src/store/disputeSlice.js`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Manage dispute-related state using Redux or Context API.
    - Handle actions for fetching, adding, and updating disputes.

### Testing

#### 8. API Tests
- **File:** `tests/api/disputes.test.js`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Write unit tests for API endpoints.
