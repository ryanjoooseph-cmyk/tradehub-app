# Implementation Plan for Feature 'disputes_backend_326'

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of the UI and API for managing disputes at the route `/api/disputes`. The feature will support opening, listing, and updating disputes with an `evidence_urls` array and a status field that can be OPEN, REVIEW, or RESOLVED.

### UI Implementation

  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Display a list of disputes with their statuses and evidence URLs.
    - Provide options to filter disputes by status.

- **File:** `src/components/DisputeForm.js`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Create a form for opening a new dispute or updating an existing one.
    - Include fields for `evidence_urls` and `status`.

#### 6. API Service
- **File:** `src/services/disputeService.js`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Implement functions to call the API for creating, listing, and updating disputes.
    - Handle API responses and errors.

#### 7. State Management
- **File:** `src/store/disputeSlice.js`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Create a Redux slice or context for managing dispute state.
    - Implement actions for fetching, adding, and updating disputes.

### Testing

#### 8. API Tests
- **File:** `tests/api/disputes.test.js`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Write unit tests for API endpoints.
    - Test various scenarios including valid and invalid requests.

#### 9. UI Tests
- **File:** `tests/ui/DisputeForm.test.js`
