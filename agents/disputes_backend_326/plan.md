# Implementation Plan for Feature 'disputes_backend_326'

## Overview

  - `src/pages/DisputePage.js`
    - **Responsibilities**: 
      - Main page for disputes.
      - Integrate DisputeList and DisputeForm components.

  - `src/services/disputeService.js`
    - **Responsibilities**: 
      - API calls to the backend for disputes (GET, POST, PUT).
      - Handle responses and errors from the API.

  - `src/hooks/useDisputes.js`
    - **Responsibilities**: 
      - Custom hook for managing dispute state.
      - Fetch disputes and handle updates.

### Testing

- **File Paths**
  - `src/tests/api/dispute.test.js`
    - **Responsibilities**: 
      - Unit tests for API endpoints.
      - Test CRUD operations and status management.

  - `src/tests/ui/DisputeForm.test.js`
    - **Responsibilities**:

    - **Responsibilities**:

      - Ensure correct rendering of disputes.

## Timeline
- **Week 1**: Set up API endpoints and database model.
- **Week 2**: Implement dispute controller and middleware.
- **Week 3**: Develop UI components and integrate with API.
