# Implementation Plan for Feature 'disputes_backend_326'

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of the UI and API for managing disputes at the route `/api/disputes`. The feature will support opening, listing, and updating disputes, with an `evidence_urls` array and status management (OPEN/REVIEW/RESOLVED).

  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Define routes for GET, POST, and PUT requests.
    - Handle request validation and response formatting.

#### 2. Controller
- **File:** `src/controllers/disputeController.js`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Implement logic for creating, retrieving, and updating disputes.
    - Manage status transitions and validate `evidence_urls`.

#### 3. Model
- **File:** `src/models/Dispute.js`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Define the Dispute schema with fields: `id`, `status`, `evidence_urls`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
    - Implement methods for database interactions (CRUD operations).

#### 4. Middleware
- **File:** `src/middleware/validateDispute.js`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Validate incoming request data for disputes (e.g., required fields, URL format).
    - Handle errors and send appropriate responses.

### UI Implementation

#### 5. UI Components
- **File:** `src/components/DisputeList.js`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Display a list of disputes with their statuses and evidence URLs.
    - Implement pagination and filtering options.

- **File:** `src/components/DisputeForm.js`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Create a form for opening and updating disputes.
    - Include fields for status selection and evidence URL input.

#### 6. API Service
- **File:** `src/services/disputeService.js`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Implement functions to call the API for fetching, creating, and updating disputes.
    - Handle API responses and errors.

#### 7. State Management
- **File:** `src/store/disputeSlice.js`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Manage the state of disputes using Redux or Context API.
    - Handle actions for fetching, adding, and updating disputes.

### Testing

#### 8. API Tests
- **File:** `tests/api/disputes.test.js`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Write unit tests for API endpoints.
    - Test various scenarios including valid and invalid requests.

#### 9. UI Tests
- **File:** `tests/ui/DisputeForm.test.js`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Write tests for the DisputeForm component.
    - Validate form submission and error handling.

## Deployment
- **File:** `docker-compose.yml`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Define services for the application and database.
    - Ensure the API and UI are properly configured for deployment.

## Documentation
