# Implementation Plan for Feature 'disputes_backend_326'

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of the UI and API for managing disputes at the route `/api/disputes`. The feature will support opening, listing, and updating disputes, including handling an `evidence_urls` array and managing dispute statuses (OPEN, REVIEW, RESOLVED).

## File Structure

### API Implementation

- **File Paths:**
  - `src/api/disputes.js`
    - **Responsibilities:**
      - Define API endpoints for disputes.
      - Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update).
      - Validate input data and manage status transitions.

  - `src/models/Dispute.js`
    - **Responsibilities:**
      - Define the Dispute model/schema.
      - Include fields: `id`, `status`, `evidence_urls`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.

  - `src/controllers/disputeController.js`
    - **Responsibilities:**
      - Handle business logic for disputes.
      - Implement functions for creating, listing, and updating disputes.

  - `src/routes/disputeRoutes.js`
    - **Responsibilities:**
      - Set up Express routes for `/api/disputes`.
      - Connect routes to the appropriate controller methods.

  - `src/middleware/validateDispute.js`
    - **Responsibilities:**
      - Middleware for validating dispute data (e.g., status, evidence_urls).

### UI Implementation

- **File Paths:**
  - `src/components/DisputeList.js`
    - **Responsibilities:**
      - Display a list of disputes.
      - Include filters for status (OPEN, REVIEW, RESOLVED).

  - `src/components/DisputeForm.js`
    - **Responsibilities:**
      - Form for creating and updating disputes.
      - Handle input for evidence URLs and status selection.

  - `src/pages/DisputePage.js`
    - **Responsibilities:**
      - Main page for managing disputes.
      - Integrate `DisputeList` and `DisputeForm` components.

  - `src/services/disputeService.js`
    - **Responsibilities:**
      - API calls to the backend for disputes (GET, POST, PUT).
      - Handle responses and errors.

  - `src/hooks/useDisputes.js`
    - **Responsibilities:**
      - Custom hook for managing dispute state.
      - Fetch disputes and handle updates.

### Testing

- **File Paths:**
  - `src/tests/api/disputes.test.js`
    - **Responsibilities:**
      - Unit tests for API endpoints.
      - Test CRUD operations and status transitions.

  - `src/tests/components/DisputeForm.test.js`
    - **Responsibilities:**
      - Unit tests for the DisputeForm component.
      - Validate form submission and error handling.

  - `src/tests/components/DisputeList.test.js`
    - **Responsibilities:**
      - Unit tests for the DisputeList component.
      - Validate rendering and filtering of disputes.

## Timeline
- **Week 1:**
  - Set up API endpoints and model.
  - Implement basic CRUD operations.

- **Week 2:**
  - Develop UI components and integrate with API.
  - Implement state management with hooks.

- **Week 3:**
  - Write tests for API and UI components.
  - Conduct code reviews and finalize implementation.

## Notes
- Ensure proper error handling and validation throughout the API and UI.
- Consider user experience for managing disputes effectively.
- Document API endpoints and UI components for future reference.
