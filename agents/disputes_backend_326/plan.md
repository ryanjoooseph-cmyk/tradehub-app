- **File:** `src/components/DisputeList.js`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Fetch and display a list of disputes.
    - Provide options to view details and update status.

#### 6. Dispute Form Component
- **File:** `src/components/DisputeForm.js`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Handle the creation and updating of disputes.
    - Include fields for status selection and evidence URLs input.

#### 7. API Service
- **File:** `src/services/disputeService.js`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Implement functions to call API endpoints for disputes (GET, POST, PUT).
    - Handle API responses and errors.

### Testing

#### 8. API Tests
- **File:** `tests/api/disputes.test.js`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Write unit tests for API endpoints.
    - Validate response formats and status codes.

#### 9. UI Tests
- **File:** `tests/ui/DisputeForm.test.js`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Write tests for the Dispute Form component.
