# Implementation Plan for Feature 'disputes_backend_326'

## Overview
This plan outlines the development of the UI and API for managing disputes at the route `/api/disputes`. The feature will support opening, listing, and updating disputes, including handling an array of evidence URLs and managing dispute statuses (OPEN, REVIEW, RESOLVED).

#### 2. Controller
- **File:** `src/controllers/disputeController.js`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Implement logic for creating, retrieving, and updating disputes.

#### 3. Model
- **File:** `src/models/dispute.js`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Define the Dispute schema with fields: `id`, `status`, `evidence_urls`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
    - Implement methods for database interactions (CRUD operations).

#### 4. Middleware
- **File:** `src/middleware/validateDispute.js`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Validate incoming requests for creating and updating disputes.
    - Ensure evidence_urls is an array and status is one of OPEN/REVIEW/RESOLVED.

### UI Implementation

#### 5. UI Components
- **File:** `src/components/DisputeList.js`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Display a list of disputes with their statuses and evidence URLs.
    - Implement pagination and filtering options.

- **File:** `src/components/DisputeForm.js`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Provide a form for creating and updating disputes.
    - Include fields for status selection and evidence URL input.

#### 6. API Service
- **File:** `src/services/disputeService.js`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Implement API calls to interact with the `/api/disputes` endpoint.
    - Handle responses and errors from the API.

#### 7. State Management
- **File:** `src/store/disputeSlice.js`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Manage the state of disputes using Redux or Context API.
    - Handle actions for fetching, creating, and updating disputes.

### Testing

#### 8. API Tests
- **File:** `tests/api/disputes.test.js`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Write unit tests for API endpoints.
    - Test validation and error handling.

#### 9. UI Tests
- **File:** `tests/ui/DisputeForm.test.js`
  - **Responsibilities:**
