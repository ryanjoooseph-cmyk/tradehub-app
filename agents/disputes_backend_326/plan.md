#### 7. State Management
- **File:** `src/store/disputeSlice.js`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Manage dispute state using Redux or Context API.
    - Handle actions for fetching, creating, and updating disputes.

### Testing

#### 8. API Tests
- **File:** `tests/api/disputes.test.js`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Write unit tests for API endpoints.
    - Test validation and error handling.

#### 9. UI Tests
- **File:** `tests/ui/DisputeForm.test.js`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Write tests for the DisputeForm component.
    - Ensure form validation and submission work as expected.
