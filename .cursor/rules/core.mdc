# TradeHub Core Rules (non-negotiable)

## Scope control
- Only implement the current PR from docs/development-roadmap.md.
- Only touch the Allowed Files for that PR.
- If more files are needed, STOP and split into a new PR.

## No-regression constraints
- Do not regress AppShell / Topbar / Sidebar / Theme behavior.
- Do not rename routes unless explicitly required by the PR.

## Tooling lock
- Do not change build tooling, workflows, pnpm/workspace, lockfiles, Next build modes, or deployment scripts unless the PR explicitly targets them.

## Required gates (must pass before push)
- pnpm lint
- pnpm typecheck
- pnpm build

## PR requirements
- PR description must include:
  - Goal (1 sentence)
  - Allowed files list (copy/paste)
  - Commands run (lint/typecheck/build)
  - Routes tested
  - Screenshots (before/after for UI changes)
