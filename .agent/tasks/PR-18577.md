# Agent Task 4

## Objective
Add server-side env validation at startup (warn hard if missing required envs)

## Rules
- Work only on what is needed to complete the objective.
- Keep changes minimal and production-safe.
- Ensure `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` pass.
- If you touch env vars: update docs, do NOT commit secrets.
