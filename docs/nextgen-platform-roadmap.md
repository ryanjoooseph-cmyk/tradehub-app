# Next-Generation Platform Transformation Roadmap
**Target:** $100M+ Valuation SaaS Platform  
**Mission:** Completely dominate Simpro, Tradify, ServiceM8 with never-before-seen capabilities  
**Timeline:** 6-12 months to market leadership

## Executive Summary

**Current State:** Solid foundation (95% complete per audit), functional features, decent UI  
**Gap Analysis:** Lacks professional polish, predictive intelligence, real-time collaboration, mobile-first design
