Here's a minimal Next.js page component for the specified path `app/jobs/page.tsx`. This component includes a heading and some placeholder content.

```tsx
// app/jobs/page.tsx

import React from 'react';

const PageJobs: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Job Listings</h1>
      <p>This is a placeholder for job listings content.</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default PageJobs;
```

This component can be expanded later with actual job listing data as needed.
